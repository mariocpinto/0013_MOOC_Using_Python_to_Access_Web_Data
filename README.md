This repository contains [course notes](Course_Notes.md) from the Coursera MOOC [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data). This MOOC is the third of four courses in the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).

This repository is also intended to showcase the work I did while completing this MOOC - My [course completion records](Course_Completion.md) are also included in this repository.
